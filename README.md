# DriveAccess
DriveAccess is a complete backend system that enables verified and qualified users to lease different types of vehicles for a reasonable fee.  The platform allows admins to manage vehicles, qualifications, and payments, while drivers can browse available vehicles they qualify for, request leases, and make payments.
